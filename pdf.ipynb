      "with luxury garment renting within a collaborative consumption context. To this\n",

      "* **Barriers:** Several inhibitors or perceived risks associated with fashion rental consumption were also identified. These include dissatisfaction with service and poor product performance, functional performance, safety, trust, level of difficulty in usage, degree of familiarity of rental trade, compatibility, and self-efficacy. Other perceived barriers include factors such as ease of use with respect to convenience, lack of accessibility, technical requirements, resistance toward habit transformation, hassle in the cancellation process, financial risks, social risks, and physical risks such as hygiene issues or contamination concerns.\n",

Past literature argued that the purchase of luxury goods was driven by people's motivation to conform or fit into our economic and social system. In this study, the authors focus on a new aspect of consumption, that is, renting instead of purchase luxury goods. Drawing upon the analysis of spontaneous consumers' online communications, the study explores consumers' motivations to engage with renting as collaborative luxuryconsumption mode.
